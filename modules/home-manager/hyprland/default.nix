# Beginner orientation:
#
# This is the entry point for the Home Manager side of the Hyprland profile.
# "Entry point" means other config files import this module, and this module
# imports the smaller Hyprland-related files under ./modules/.
#
# This file itself stays thin, mirroring the split the gnome profile uses
# (modules/home-manager/gnome/default.nix + modules/home-manager/gnome/
# modules/*.nix): it declares the top-level options (enable, wallpaper),
# wires up the imports, and owns the handful of settings that genuinely
# belong to the whole profile rather than one subsystem -- the shared
# session target, session-variable plumbing, baseline packages, mime
# defaults, and portals. Everything else lives under ./modules/:
# - modules/commands.nix: shared helper-script packages (screenshot,
#   screenrecord, caffeine) and the local.hyprland.commands option tree
# - modules/compositor.nix: compositor config (monitors, input, decoration,
#   animations, window rules)
# - modules/hyprshell.nix: the hyprshell Alt-Tab window switcher daemon
# - modules/keybindings.nix: every Hyprland key chord
# - modules/hyprlock.nix: lock-screen look and behavior
# - modules/hypridle.nix: idle locking behavior
# - modules/hyprsunset.nix: display color temperature schedule
# - modules/session-services.nix: extra Hyprland-session user services
# - modules/silere.nix: the silere-shell Quickshell bar (packaging + user
#   service)
# - modules/wallpaper.nix: the wallpaper pipeline (awww + matugen + hyprlock's
#   stable path) and the Vicinae wallpaper commands
#
# silere-shell is the sole shell for this profile -- there is no backend
# option, unlike the old Caffyne/Quickshell split this profile tore down.
# silere.nix declares its first-generation defaults; the shell's own
# Settings UI can still override any of them per-key at runtime.
