# Beginner orientation:
#
# This module owns every Hyprland key chord: application launches,
# screenshot/screenrecord binds, window management, workspace switching,
# mouse drag/resize, and the hardware media/brightness keys. Window rules,
# compositor config (input/general/decoration/animations/monitor), and
# services stay in default.nix.
#
# Every chord is declared once in `bindDefs` below with a human description
# and a group, and two artifacts derive from that single list:
#   1. the Hyprland lua binds (the description rides along as a bind option,
#      so `hyprctl binds` is self-documenting), and
#   2. ~/.local/share/silere/keybinds.json, the data behind the shell's
#      searchable keybindings viewer (silere.nix points its keybindsFile
#      key here; Super+/ opens the viewer).
# Entries with `viewer = false` bind without cluttering the viewer (the 20
# generated workspace chords collapse into two synthetic rows instead), and
# `viewerExtras` documents chords this module does not own -- the hyprshell
# switcher registers its own binds with the daemon, and gestures are not
# binds at all -- so the viewer still lists them.
#
# AGENTS.md's rule to keep equivalent GNOME and Hyprland keybindings on the
# same chord applies here: before changing a binding, check the GNOME
# profile and preserve parity unless a desktop-specific constraint requires
# an intentional difference.
