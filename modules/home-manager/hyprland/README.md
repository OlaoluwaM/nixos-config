# Hyprland Desktop

This folder builds the Hyprland desktop.

Hyprland is the program that draws and moves windows. This kind of program is
called a compositor. The desktop also uses:

- `silere-shell` for the bar, menus, popups, and wallpaper picker.
- Vicinae for the app launcher and clipboard history.
- hyprshell for the Alt+Tab window switcher.
- hyprlock for the lock screen.
- hypridle for lock, screen-off, and sleep timers.
- hyprsunset for warmer screen colors at night.

Set `desktopProfile = "hyprland"` for the host in `flake.nix` to turn this
desktop on.

## File Map

Each file has one main job:

- `modules/nixos/hyprland.nix` sets up Hyprland, the login screen, Bluetooth,
  KDE Connect, file access services, and helpers that let apps share the screen
  and choose files.
- `default.nix` joins the Home Manager files together. It also sets shared
  apps, file defaults, and the desktop session group.
- `modules/commands.nix` packages the helper scripts and shares their paths
  with the other files.
- `modules/compositor.nix` controls screens, the mouse, the keyboard, window
  rules, borders, blur, and animations.
- `modules/keybindings.nix` holds the normal keyboard and mouse shortcuts.
- `modules/hyprlock.nix` controls the lock screen.
- `modules/hypridle.nix` controls what happens when the computer is left alone.
- `modules/hyprshell.nix` packages and starts the Alt+Tab switcher.
- `modules/hyprsunset.nix` controls the night color schedule.
- `modules/session-services.nix` starts the media idle blocker, Caffeine, and
  the KDE Connect tray icon.
- `modules/silere.nix` packages and starts `silere-shell`. It also sends the
  default shell settings into the package.
- `modules/wallpaper.nix` joins awww, Matugen, and hyprlock into one wallpaper
  system.
- `scripts/` holds the Bash code used by the helper commands.
- `../vicinae.nix` sets up Vicinae and starts it with this desktop.

## How Login Works

```text
greetd -> tuigreet -> Hyprland -> hyprland.lua -> hyprland-session.target
```

`greetd` runs the login screen. `tuigreet` asks for the user name and password.
It then starts Hyprland.

Home Manager writes `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua`. That file starts
`hyprland-session.target`. A target is a named group of background programs.
This target starts and stops the desktop programs together.

The group includes the shell, launcher, wallpaper services, idle tools,
Alt+Tab switcher, KDE Connect icon, and keyring.

This desktop does not use UWSM.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Most shortcuts live in `modules/keybindings.nix`. That file also makes the
list shown by the shell, so the real shortcuts and the shown shortcuts come
from the same place.

- Press `Super+/` to open the shortcut list.
- Press `Super+Shift+W` to open the wallpaper picker.
- Press `Super+Space`, or tap `Super`, to open Vicinae.
- Press `Alt+Tab` to switch windows.

hyprshell owns `Alt+Tab` itself. This is the one normal shortcut that does not
come from `modules/keybindings.nix`.

## Helper Scripts

The files in `scripts/` are pieces of Bash code. Home Manager wraps each file
with `pkgs.writeShellApplication`. The wrapper adds Bash safety settings and
makes the programs that each script needs available.

- `hypr-shell-screenshot` takes an area, screen, or window screenshot.
- `hypr-shell-record` records an area, screen, or window.
- `hypr-shell-caffeine` turns Caffeine on or off so the computer can stay
  awake.
- `wallpaper-set` applies one image to the desktop, shell colors, and lock
  screen.

## Lock, Screen-Off, and Sleep

hypridle watches for keyboard and mouse use.

- After 10 minutes with no use, it locks the session.
- After 11 minutes, it turns the screens off.
- After 15 minutes, it puts the computer to sleep.

Video or audio playback can block these timers. Caffeine can also block them
until the user turns it off.

## Wallpapers

The wallpaper picker reads `$WALLPAPERS_DIR`. If that value is not set, it
uses `~/Pictures/wallpapers`.

When an image is picked, `wallpaper-set <image-path>` does this:

1. It checks that the image can be read.
2. It gives the image to awww. awww uses a two-second `grow` animation at 60
   frames per second.
3. It gives the image to Matugen. Matugen builds the dark `SchemeContent`
   colors used by `silere-shell`.
4. It converts the image to PNG and saves it at
   `~/.config/hypr/wallpapers/default.png` for hyprlock.

Home Manager creates the PNG the first time if it does not exist. It does not
replace a wallpaper that is already there. At login, the restore service gives
this saved image back to awww.

Home Manager also builds Matugen's config and links it to
`~/.config/matugen/config.toml`. Matugen caching stays off because Matugen
would still rebuild the `SchemeContent` colors used here. The cache would add
files without making this wallpaper path faster.

The picker can be opened with `Super+Shift+W`. It can also be found as
`Wallpapers` in Vicinae.
